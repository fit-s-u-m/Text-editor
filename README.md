# DSA-Project-
A Repo for our data structure and algorithms project which is "text editor "
This Project is highly guided by [this]("https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/") book
To run the code write **make** and then run the excutable **./texty**
since we worked on it on a linux machine and the code has  one dependancy called "termios" which is only available on a unix like machines(Computers) it doesn't compile on windows
